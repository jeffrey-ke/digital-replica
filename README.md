Possible datasets:
- http://www.scan-net.org/
- We take our own videos of our house
- https://jonbarron.info/zipnerf/
- ^(this is a good indoor dataset)

Rationale behind doing indoor scenes is it could be cool to show off a product. 
Worth considering if real estate people are "desparate" for a solution like this, and nothing like it is good enough.
